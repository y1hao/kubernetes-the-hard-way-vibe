# Chapter 11 Execution Plan â€” RBAC, Security, and Policies

## Execution Steps
1. Ensure Metrics Server can run on worker nodes by labelling workers (if needed), patching the deployment to target workers, and validating it reports Ready while scraping all kubelets.
2. Create `chapter11/manifests/admin-clusterrolebinding.yaml` that binds the `admin` user to the `cluster-admin` ClusterRole.
3. Create `chapter11/manifests/default-deny-networkpolicy.yaml` that enforces default deny ingress and egress within the `default` namespace.
4. Create `chapter11/manifests/default-allow-from-ingress.yaml` that permits ingress into `default` workloads from namespaces labelled `networking.k8s.io/policy-role=ingress`.
5. Write `chapter11/README.md` covering manifest application steps, namespace labelling guidance, kubelet read-only port verification, Metrics Server worker validation steps, and why existing security group rules remain in place.
6. Capture validation commands in `chapter11/README.md`, including RBAC checks with a non-admin kubeconfig and NetworkPolicy probe guidance for the operator to run from the bastion.
