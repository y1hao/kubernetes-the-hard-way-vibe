# Chapter 14 Execution Plan — Cleanup and Final State

1. Scaffold `chapter14/` assets by creating `README.md` and a `docs/` directory to host the teardown guidance, linking the pieces together.
2. Author `chapter14/docs/cleanup-checklist.md` with the copy-pasteable teardown command blocks and the manual AWS resource checklist spelled out step by step.
3. Refresh `ARCHITECTURE.md` to align with the finished build: replace the ASCII VPC diagram with a Mermaid version, add a second Mermaid diagram covering node-level components, and update any text that’s now outdated per the latest ADRs.
4. Append the Chapter 14 outcome summary to the root `README.md` once the docs and architecture updates are complete.
