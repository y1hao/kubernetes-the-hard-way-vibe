# Chapter 14 â€” Cleanup and Final State

This chapter captures how to dismantle the Kubernetes the Hard Way lab and record the finished architecture. Start with the cleanup checklist in `docs/cleanup-checklist.md` (populated in later steps) for copy-pasteable teardown commands and the manual AWS inventory to review before destroying resources.

Once the documentation and architecture refresh are complete, this README will summarize the validated Chapter 14 outcome for quick reference.
